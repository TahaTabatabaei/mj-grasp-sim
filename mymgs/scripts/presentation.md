# Grasp Pose Generation

## mj-grasp-sim (Bosch)
The MuJoCo Grasping Simulator framework. Simulates grasp generation in MuJoCo using different grippers. (I tried Robotiq_2f85).\
I want **to run my own experiments** and simulate how the grasp would behave in real physics.\

***Q: where and how I should use the scan function?***\
A: 


***Q: how can I generate grasps for our problem?***\
A: 

--> check if you can import .obj and if the giskard can reach it or not (can make a trajecttory).
